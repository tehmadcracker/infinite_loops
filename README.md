#The Mad Cracker Manifesto

Imagine a time when time travel is possible. Would you go back? What if you didn’t have a choice? What if just the first test, was a success, but yet, a massive failure for time? What if there was a bit of true random? What if you suddenly realized, that at that very moment, what you were doing had already happened? Would you call it Deja vu?

If you went back, and changed one thing, suddenly, that future you came from, may not exist. That one thing changed, would spark the butterfly effect, which is the result of true random existing. Now, you realize that your future no longer exists because you changed something with the true random you entered into that reality. So, what do you do? You would need to remove that true random you injected to get back to the future that brought you there. What if you couldn’t, but suddenly something didn’t happen, and you were suddenly displaced back to the point in time in which you originally arrived? What if your presence at that time was all that was necessary for the true random that you injected to be injected?

What would you do? You were just displaced in time for some reason, for something not happening. What if that something that didn’t happen, was the event of time travel itself? So, what could you do? You would need for that event to take place, so, one thing you could do, is pass that information from father to son, wash, rinse, repeat. That may be all you will be able to do. But how could you keep that tradition alive? Possibly with predictions? Prophecies? Something like the book of Nostradamus? Vague milestones, to know you’re on the right path... 

You would need a system, you would need help, you would need a highly motivated group of individuals to make sure certain things happen, so that something can happen. Would you pass books down, from generation, to generation? From family, to civilization? Hide clues in flagship monuments? In language? Simply, so that information wouldn’t be recognized until future generation’s milestones were met, so that just the recognition of those clues were enough to be considered a milestone? What if, on that path, something else happens, and suddenly you realize that the recreation of events, so that specific event of something happens, actually occurred due to the result of the recreation of events. Meaning, what if the recreation of events, had actually already happened, prior to you traveling for the first time, and that you getting to the point of traveling in time, was actually a recreation of events so that time travel could exist because of someone else.

This world we live in is advancing rather quickly with technology, we’ve spent super power deficits on machines that we weren't even sure would do anything at all, we conquered physics in less than 2000 years, conquering quantum physics in less than 100, or have we been working on quantum physics since the great philosphers of our time were hanging out and chatting about things they couldn't prove, but could only question? For instance, if a tree falls in the woods, and no one is there to hear it, does it make a sound? Right now, quantum physicists are pondering the same question, due to one experiment that anyone with means can recreate, the Double Slit experiment. This BBC Documentary explains it all with a nice and neat cartoon, check it out https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1YqgPAtzho
